title: "Many hands make light work."
desc: "To everyone who helped: combing the beach for rubble, cutting wood and metal, loading sleds and sacks, toting loads, offering kind words, strong hands, and so much heart (not to mention homemade cookies): A very big THANK YOU!! The day was a huge success, with a fifty member human chain moving 9000 lbs of shipwreck.  She was loaded for transport by 2:30. Both tanks were removed as well as all the boat debris that made it to the beach."

To everyone who helped: combing the beach for rubble, cutting wood and metal, loading sleds and sacks, toting loads,
offering kind words, strong hands, and so much heart (not to mention homemade cookies): A very big THANK YOU!! The day
was a huge success, with a fifty member human chain moving 9000 lbs of shipwreck. She was loaded for transport by 2:30.
Both tanks were removed as well as all the boat debris that made it to the beach.

Hopefully there is a crane in our future, that will lift the engine, transmission and ballast. Stay tuned.
