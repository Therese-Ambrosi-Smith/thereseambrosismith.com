Proceeds from the sale of “Wax” will help fund new exhibits at Rosie the Riveter/ WWII Home Front National Historical
Park. Click on the “Buy Books” link in the top menu bar.

“Wax” tells the story of a young woman who struggles to conform to post-war expectations of marriage and family. The
Rosie the Riveter Trust has sold the book in the Rosie the Riveter/ WWII Home Front National Historical Park visitor
center store since it opened, and I’m grateful for their support. Now it’s time to give back. All proceeds from the sale
of the print version of “Wax” – through this website or the National Park bookstore – will be donated to the Rosie The
Riveter Trust in support of exhibit development.
