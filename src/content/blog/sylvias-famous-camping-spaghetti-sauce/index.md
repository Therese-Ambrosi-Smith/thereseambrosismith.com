When “Wax” was nearly ready to print, I was asked to provide two pages of filler. The printer’s final page “signature” is produced in multiples of eight, so my 334 page book was a little short. What would be worth printing?

Clue: the women are eating spaghetti in two important scenes.

**Sylvia’s Famous Spaghetti Sauce Recipe** (As adapted for the two-burner propane stove in Airstream No. 28)

Back home in Kansas City, Sylvia would spend all day on a rich meat sauce starting with garlic and olive oil and cubes of pork and beef shoulder, seared at 475 degrees for half an hour. She’d transfer the meat to a big stock pot with two quarts of broth, veal bones and vegetables. A long, slow simmer in the broth would tenderize the tough but flavorful cuts of meat, and to the whole she would add tomatoes and the remaining seasonings. The sauce would then simmer for another six hours until the meat fell apart. Everyone she treated to a serving of her Famous Spaghetti Sauce said it was the best ever.

She refined her technique — using ground beef — so she could make “Camping Spaghetti Sauce” for her nephew Robbie on their camping trips. In her tiny Airstream trailer, with few cooking utensils, Sylvia did her best to recreate that treat for Tilly and Doris.

3 Tbsp unsalted butter<br>
2 Tbsp minced garlic<br>
2 Tbsp minced onion<br>
¼ cup minced carrots<br>
¼ cup minced celery<br>
¾ lb ground meat – can be pork and beef mixed<br>
3 cloves<br>
1 C whole milk<br>
2 C dry white wine<br>
1 28 oz can whole tomatoes packed in juice<br>
1 Tbsp oregano – fresh, minced<br>
one more tablespoon minced garlic<br>
salt to taste<br>

Melt the butter in a sauce pan over a very low flame and add two tablespoons garlic. Simmer the garlic very slowly until tender. The more slowly it cooks, the sweeter it will be.

Add the carrots, onion and celery and sauté until the onions are soft. Do not brown. Add the cloves.

Add the ground meat and stir to heat evenly for about three minutes, until the meat is gray but not browned.

Add the milk and allow it to simmer until evaporated, about twelve minutes; follow with the wine. When the wine has evaporated, add the tomatoes with liquid and the oregano. Allow the sauce to simmer on the lowest possible flame, for three more hours. Thirty minutes before it’s finished, add the final tablespoon of minced garlic. Add salt if desired.

Note: this recipe wasn’t included in the final version of “Wax”. It was replaced by a list of shipyards that launched Liberty ships built by women in the 1940s. I’ve posted it here because it’s a really good sauce and reading the book might make you hungry. Enjoy!

“The time went by so quickly; we never had a chance to make plans,” Doris said. “When the ships on the line are launched we’ll be sent home too.”
“Now come on girls,” Sylvia said. “This is our last night together in The Land of C. Let’s have a little more optimism. We’ll be at peace soon.” She adjusted the seasonings and gave the sauce a final stir. Her red hair color was starting to fade. “All those love-starved men will be returning to wine and dine you marriage-age treasures. Life will be good,” Sylvia said. She looked at Tilly.
Tilly winced.
Sylvia drained the spaghetti into a bowl and loaded three plates. Then she ladled the rich meat sauce on top.
Tilly took the first bite. She twirled her fork and wrapped the length of the spaghetti around the tines. “Thank you so much, Sylvia. I’ll never forget this meal.”
