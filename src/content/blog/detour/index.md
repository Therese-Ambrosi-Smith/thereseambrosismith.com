I took a little side trip of my own today. Sometimes if the weather’s nice and the tank is full, I’ll follow the GPS
instead of the map. Usually the route is direct; unfortunately it’s not always paved. Here I’m waiting for my turn to
cross a river without a bridge.

It’s been a year since “Wax” was published and I hit the road in my tin can camper. Posts about the book tour are
archived [here](/events/), and at [https://womeninthe1940s.com](https://womeninthe1940s.com). If you like women’s
fiction and history, please visit that site too.

I hope we cross paths some day.
