Last night one hundred friends gathered on the back patio of The Gate in Belmont to celebrate the publication of "Wax". Many, many thanks to all who helped with the event: Jackie Enx for organizing the band, Larry Poncini for the fabulous roast pig, Rhonda, Susan, Julie and Barry for set up and decorations. Here they are at work!
