An important stop on the Tin Can Camper Book Tour!

I never know what to expect and I'm never disappointed.

Bob's Beach Books is a small but vibrant store in Lincoln City, Oregon. The staff orchestrated a delightful day for readers and writers, scheduling two morning talks with authors and publishers at the Bijou Theater - just down the block -- then housing about fifty authors in tents for an afternoon of book signing. Wonderful volunteers served snacks throughout the day and the event culminated with a reception hosted by book-lovers Sheila and Everett. The food and Oregon wines were delicious. I'm told Shelia spent a week cooking; I was especially partial to the stuffed mushrooms. Yum.

I hope I get invited back next year. Hint. I had a great time.
