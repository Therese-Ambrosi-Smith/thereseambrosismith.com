A year after its publication, a reviewer in Canada wrote this about “[Wax](https://womeninthe1940s.com).” Maybe it’s time to start thinking about a sequel!

[WAX](https://womeninthe1940s.com), by Therese Ambrosi Smith, is a story inspired by Rosie the Riveter and the women
who stepped up, and into the industrial void that was left when practically an entire generation of American men went
away to war. They became silent partners in the war effort, the cogs and the gears of the American war machine, and
without their efforts the solid foundation, upon which the war was being fought, would have crumbled.

Waitresses, sales girls, and homemakers, these women braved the unknown to be a part of something bigger than
themselves, and end up learning that they were never small to begin with.

By setting the novel during a time in American history when women were encouraged to step out of the kitchen, literally
and metaphorically, and into roles that they would never have been allowed to pursue during peacetime, Smith challenges
her characters, and readers, to question the very nature of gender limitations, and expectation.

The war effort itself could easily have become a major character in this novel but, instead, Smith does a magnificent
job of simply placing the story, and its characters, in an historically, and emotionally, relevant context. She
recognizes how much potential there is for character growth in her chosen setting and uses that as a vehicle to take her
characters places they normally wouldn’t have gone; making them see things in themselves that would have otherwise
stayed hidden beneath their mother’s hand-me-down aprons.

And then, just as the characters adjust to their new realities as welders, painters, and dozens of other normally
male-dominated professions, with financial and emotional independence, the war ends and these women are expected to
somehow fit themselves back into their old lives and expectations. That is where the novel really spreads its wings and
starts to fly.

The relationships these characters have with each other, and with themselves, are so real and honest that they jump from
the page, and make you care about them as though they were long-cherished friends. I found myself in every character in
this book, their fears and their joys, their ambitions and their self-doubt―these characters cry and breathe and laugh,
and hold a mirror up to our own era, with its lingering biases and judgements.

While this time in American history is, undoubtedly, significant in a thousand ways, I probably would not pick up a
textbook to read about it. I want to read about people. The stories and characters within historical fiction often seem
provided simply as a pretext for teaching people about the chosen historical era. What delighted me about WAX is that
Therese Ambrosi Smith uses the era to the teach the characters and the reader about themselves.

Touching and funny, with good pacing, and amazing characters, WAX is a novel that only disappoints in that it ends too
soon, and doesn’t have a sequel waiting in the wings.
