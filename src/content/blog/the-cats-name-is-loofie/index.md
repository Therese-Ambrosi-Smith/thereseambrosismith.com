I met Alice “Loofie” Aloof in 1995 at the Juneau pound. Eagles thin the stray cat population in Alaska; there were only
four felines awaiting adoption. Loofie stood out because she had no interest in us. She was trying to figure out how to
unlatch the cage. While other cats napped, she was planning an escape.

She was a young adult cat when she moved in and took over. The only history the shelter could share came from the
property manager who’d brought her in after a tenant had left her behind. He guessed she’d been in the apartment alone
for four days.

Perhaps it’s because she was abandoned, but she likes to come on trips. She attracts lots of attention at rest areas,
walking around on leash. Pet friendly Motel 6 is her accommodation of choice.

Recently Loofie joined me at a Bob’s Beach Books event in Lincoln City Oregon. I was there to sign books, but Loofie got
all the attention. Everyone who visited opened the conversation with “What’s your cat’s name?”

She’s a senior citizen now, but still a charmer – tolerant of excessive petting from children (and adults too). I heard
sad tales from cat aficionados who’d recently lost beloved pets. They came to see Loofie for their “kitty fix”. She did
not disappoint.
